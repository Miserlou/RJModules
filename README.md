### New Stuff!

#### Gluten Free
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mah5XUi.png" width="25%">

**Gluten Free** is an STK-based granulator. It makes horrible, horrible noises. It has six knobs, all of which you can play with. It works best if you load short files and turn the voices up. I wanted to add a V/Oct controller but couldn't figure out how to do that with the framework - want to help?

It's a wild beast, but with enough twiddling, you can tame it and it sounds fucking awesome.

#### MegaDivider
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ik0hlxq.png" width="50%">

**Mega Divider** is a 1:64 clock divider! Also includes two 'multi' divisions, which will generate signals when either of the two divisions are active.

#### Gaussian
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dBThKyJ.png" width="10%">

**Gaussian** is a normal distribution generator! It has 9 trigger outputs, which will turn on randomly when ever a trigger signal or a button press is received, based on the distribution illustrated by the left-hand column of lights, which can be controlled using the Mu and Sigma knobs.

#### Instro
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EMYzw9B.png" width="25%">

**Instro** is a multi-instrument voice generator using the "STK" voices. Uses a variety of different algorithms for different instruments, including FM synthesis and an enhanced Karplus-Strong algorithm.

There is a "gate" input which is required for the plucked instruments (guitar, mandolin, etc.), and there are four different parameter controls for each instrument. Finally, there is a simple wave based drum sampler.

#### Chorus
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/gaiWFMh.png' width="8%">

**Chorus** is a simple 3HP chorus effect with CV-adjustable delay time, frequency and depth.

Chorus is the first of a few modules based on the "STK" synthesis library.

#### Octo
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/Z4F4fr3.png' width="8%">

**Octo** is a bespokely tuned voltage source for organic modulation.

It provides eight phasing waves (0-5v) ranging from quite fast to incredibly slow. There's an integrated attenuvertet so that you can generate complex, self-modifying oscillations.

It also functions as a track-and-hold, as it will sustain the current output values while a -5 attenuated CV input is given, which can be used to create cool stepping effects.

Additionally, in the right click menu, there are multiple waveform types. Square waves can be used to generate random gate/clock signals, which is fun too.

The module is also quite efficient and doesn't use very much CPU considering the number of outputs it has!

Octo is inspired by DivKid's ''Ochd'', which you should buy for your hardware modular.

#### Euclidian [sic]
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/HoEumI7.png' width="50%" />

**Euclidian** uses ancient math and nuclear physics to generate tribal rhythms. It's based on this paper: http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf. Cool! The right click menu provides a bunch of world rhythms out of the box.

Video/audio demo [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vcvrack/comments/ebn4ml/exploring_the_sacred_geometry_with_my_new/).

#### Left Hand Right Hand
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ceIn1c8.png" width="25%">

**Left Hand Right Hand** is kind of a strange expierment. It's a MIDI input device with a "split" knob that allows you two divide your MIDI instrument into two separate signal paths. This lets you play separate voices on your left and right hands on a single MIDI keyboard. An experiment, feedback welcome.

#### Ping Pong
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9RxOChc.png" width="25%">

**Ping Pong** is a clock-synced ping pong delay. Includes dotted and triplet time signatures, a "nudge" knob for making slightly-off delays, and a 0-200% feedback mode which allows you to create amazing - but dangerout - feedback swells.

#### PlayableChord
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0dudvPA.png" width="25%">
Turns a note into a chord. Octave and position controls.

#### MutateSeq / Notes / Sequential
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PFUjLNd.png" width="50%">
A suite of sequencing tools.

**MutateSeq** lets you build a sequence that mutates over time. Can lock notes and change rate of mutation.
Notes and Sequential work together to build a simple sequencer with different step modes. Can change mode and size of step.

#### Brickwall
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eA37XuY.png" width="25%">
It's a brick wall limiter! Includes a pre- and post- amplifier. Sounds awesome for making heavy kicks, or throw it on before master output to protect your ears a bit. Stomp.

#### Dry // Wet
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bfjukeC.png" width="25%">
Dual voltage controlled dry-wet knobs! For building effects chains.

#### Triggerswitch
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jMRhepg.png" width="25%">
Dual gate-and-button-based switch. Good for building 'sections'.

### Synths

#### ACID
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/zJyg3A9.png' width="50%" />

*"This thing is amaze-balls!! Been messing around with it for about 3 hours didn't even feel the time pass. Acid goodness üëèüëè"*

ACID is my take on the legendary TB-303. It features two independent multi-waveform VCOs and mixer, wavetables from the actual 303, an integrated envelope generator, a powerful filter, and a pluck circuit!

Experiment with this and you'll find yourself making some of the craziest, squelchiest acid the world has ever heard!

Oh, and there's also a hidden feature - see if you can find it!


#### EssEff
EssEff is a SoundFont (sf2) player! Comes with a few free soundfonts and the button lets you load more.

### Generators

#### Supersaw
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/ACIUKI0.png' width="25%" />
It's a supersaw! Frequency, detune and mix are all voltage controlled, and there's switches for phase, inversion and 2/3 OSC. There's also a reset button.

#### Twin LFO
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dsEUqse.png" width="50%" />
Two oscillators, one output! This thing generates crazy wubs - it's super fun! The first LFO is the "main" LFO output, the second one controls the rate of the first. Set the first one higher than the second to get crazy wub effects.

Also has a shape wheel for mixing the sin/saw shape, and has knobs for offset and inversion. All parameters are voltage controllable!

#### Noise
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/l9yj0jt.png" width="25%">
Noise generates pink and white noise! It also has an integrated high pass and low pass filter. Everything is voltage controlled, and there's a bonus volume knob.

#### Range LFO
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wtTzimg.png" width="50%" />
Range LFO is an LFO which can be explicitly mapped to a specific (controllable) range. Very handy!

### FX

#### Bit Crusher
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/tjKYMUn.png' width="50%" />

It's a bit crusher! Accepts control voltage, and sets a (voltage controlled) minimum bit depth for fine tuning.

#### Filter Delay
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9CPtg6R.png" width="25%" />
A modification of the basic delay that filters each feedbacking pass. Kind of reggaeish, good for pads too.

#### Sidechain
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3bQONmT.png" width="25%">
Based on a trigger signal, lower the volume of the input/output signal. CV controllable decay and ratio. Use a kick or a button to make some awesome wooshy noises or hard-knocking beats! I think there's a bug in this module but it works pretty good for me anyway.

#### Widener
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KL50fgV.png" width="25%" />
Widener is a CV-controlled Haas-effect stereo widener with integrated high pass/low pass filter and a mix knob. Really useful for adding motion to a lead or for making drums rumble!

#### Stutter
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oHHdCHF.png" width="25%" />
It's a digital glitch effect! Use the main on/off button (and related input) to turn the looper on and off, then use the time knob (controllable with CV) to adjust the size of the stutter. Also has a mix knob.

### Filters

#### Filter
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xv2GyWO.png" width="25%">
Filter is a voltage-controlled integrated high-pass and low-pass filter. Also includes a voltage-controlled res and mix parameter knobs. It's a really good VCF.

#### Filters
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ApBCVaC.png" width="25%">
Filters is like Volumes or Panners, but for Filters. Each knob controls both a low pass and high pass filter. Super handy!

#### Notch
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AzhKPZ1.png" width="25%">
Notch is a notch filter! You can play with the frequency, depth and width. All voltage controlled.

#### KTF
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TAHjvkB.png" width="25%">
KTF is a key-tracking filter - a filter that takes a V/OCT pitch input. So, the peak of the filter will match your note. Includes an integrated octave and glide. Sounds pretty cool on saws!

### Numerical

#### Integers
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/NRQjpmZ.png' width="25%" />
It generates three (voltage controlled) integers from -12 to +12!

#### Floats
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/spQgKmr.png' width="25%" />
It generates three (voltage controlled) floats from -12 to +12!

#### Randoms
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/CuM471K.png' width="50%" />

Generates three random values. The range of the values can be controlled via CV, but will default to (-12, +12) if CV values are empty/equal.

### Mixers

#### Left Right Mixer
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UOidGVr.png" width="25%" />
A simple 12-to-2 mixer for mixing multiple stereo signals. With an additional overall voume knob.

#### Mono
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tmSFepy.png" width="25%" />
A voltage-controlled mono-izer. Given a wide dual input signal, convert to mono outputs based on a knob and CV. Has two outputs, but only one is need if you're just going to 100% mono.

#### Volumes
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KqWUEvB.png" width="25%" />
A modification of 'Mutes' that adds the ability to adjust the volume of 10 different input-output pairs. Can be used to quiet and amplify.

#### Panner
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4z5li8u.png" width="25%" />
Panner is a voltage controlled panner. Without CV, it pans a mono signal into left and right channels based on the value of the knob. Combine with an LFO to build an autopanner!

#### Panners
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z53pj0S.png" width="25%" />
Panners is a bank of 5 panners. Each takes a stereo input and a stereo output. Pretty simple but handy for placing lots of elements around a stereo space.

### Musical

#### uQuant
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/E2mbiRr.png' width="5%">

uQuant is a very skinny micro quantizer. Includes key, scale, octave, transpose, trigger and output.

uQuant is really just a bastard skin of [Scale Quantizer mkII](https://github.com/jhoar/AmalgamatedHarmonics) by [AmalgamatedHarmonics](https://github.com/jhoar/AmalgamatedHarmonics) - so all credit goes to them!

### Live

#### BPM
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/A5MbJJq.png' width="25%">
BPM lets you set a voltage-controllable beats per minute, with an array of outputs that get a +12 signal. There is also a CV reset with a connected button.

You can get some weird polyrhythmic stuff by putting an LFO on the CV, which gives a variable BPM. Even weirder if you start using a bunch!

#### Button
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/msNcs07.png' width="25%" />
It's literally just a big ass button with six outputs. You hit it, it sends a +12 reset signal.

#### Buttons
<img src='https://i.imgur.com/A3SD0WT.png' width="25%" />
It's not one big button - it's lot of little butons!

They're arranged a drum pad, so it's fun and easy to make a playable drum pad simulator by building a circuit like this:

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/qdBbvFD.jpg' width="100%" />

#### Metaknob
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/S7caSTN.png" width="25%" />
It's a really big knob! Unipolar, bipolar and range-controlled modes.

[Demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWrgh6OjMlU)!

#### ReplayKnob
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5z6xiwB.png" width="25%" />
Replay Knob is a knob with an integrated recorder and looper. Has a reset button, start/end controls, comes in unipolar and bipolar modes, and can be used as a looper for arbitrary inputs. Great for looping human-sounding controls.

### Utilities

#### Splitter
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bvJKVEn.png" width="25%" />
It's a 1 to 9-way splitter! You've got a signal - now send it everywhere!

#### Splitters
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NVWwfnZ.png" width="25%" />
If splitting one signal to many isn't your fancy, Splitters gives you a 5:10 splitter instead! Handy!

#### Displays
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JVVs2fg.png" width="25%">
Three digital displays. Useful for debugging. Provides a passthrough output as well.

#### Range
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3EgRCQ6.png" width="50%" />
Range will map an input from one range of values to another. So, if you have an oscillator which outputs from 0/2, you can map it to a -5/5 audio signal or a -10/10 CV. Handy!
